# Run Dataformer App from a New Google Cloud Project

This guide will help you set up a Dataformer App development VM in a Google Cloud Platform project using Google Cloud Shell.

> **Note**: When Cloud Shell opens, be sure to select **Trust repo**. Some `gcloud` commands might not run in an ephemeral Cloud Shell environment.

## Standard VM

This script sets up a Debian-based VM with the Dataformer App package, Nginx, and the necessary configurations to run the Dataformer App Dev environment.

## Spot/Preemptible Instance

When running as a [spot (preemptible) instance](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/preemptible), the code and VM will behave the same way as in a regular instance, executing the startup script to configure the environment, install necessary dependencies, and run the Dataformer App application. However, **due to the nature of spot instances, the VM may be terminated at any time if Google Cloud needs to reclaim the resources**. This makes spot instances suitable for fault-tolerant, stateless, or interruptible workloads that can handle unexpected terminations and restarts.
